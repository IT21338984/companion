# 🤖 Virtual Avatar Assistant System

This is a research-based virtual assistant web application built with **React (Vite + TypeScript)** and **FastAPI**, designed to generate culturally adaptive, role-appropriate 3D human avatars based on real-time webcam input.

It's part of an academic project on **digital companions that enhance user trust, cultural alignment, and personalization**.
